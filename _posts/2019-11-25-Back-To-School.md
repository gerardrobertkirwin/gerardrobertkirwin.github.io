After my last project, I was looking for something simpler to practice my data analysis skills. 
Donâ€™t get me wrong, you can cut your teeth on building something like the map from my last post but sometimes you need to get product out quickly. 
So I went looking for some data to play around with where I could produce some simple (but not too simple) visualizations.


Once again, I turned to Tidy Tuesday. This time, in their archives, from September was [data about racial diversity in schools](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-09-24).
Until June of this year, I had worked in education the last 7 years, so this dataset would allow me to bring in my background knowledge. 
This perspective would become useful not only in the way I expected, in looking at and manipulating the data; but also in the way it was visualized.
