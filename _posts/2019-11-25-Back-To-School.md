After my last project, I was looking for something simpler to practice my data analysis skills. 
Don’t get me wrong, you can cut your teeth on building something like the map from my last post but sometimes you need to get product out quickly. 
So I went looking for some data to play around with where I could produce some simple (but not too simple) visualizations.
<br>

Once again, I turned to Tidy Tuesday. This time, in their archives, from September was [data about racial diversity in schools](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-09-24).
Until June of this year, I had worked in education the last 7 years, so this dataset would allow me to bring in my background knowledge. 
This perspective would become useful not only in the way I expected, in looking at and manipulating the data; but also in the way it was visualized.
