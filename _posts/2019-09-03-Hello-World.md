Hello world! is often the first introduction many people have to programming. Mine was MySpace. You know how many hours I tried to get a Cap'n Jazz song to play on the special player because it wasn't uploaded on MySpace?
Setting up my website has felt like that...with a lot less bangs and a bit more CSS.
