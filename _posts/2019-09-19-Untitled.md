Teaching myself R has been surprisingly easy for me. I say this not to brag or boast. I've been working on <https://www.datacamp.com/profile/gerardrobertkirwin>Data Camp's Data Analyst Track</a> for a few months now and I've worked my way through their guided exercises with ease. So the next step in my data science learning journey is to work on some projects on my own. The blogs on this site will follow these projects.

R Markdown
----------
I stumbled upon the Women In Parliament data set on Twitter

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

    summary(cars)

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

Including Plots
---------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
