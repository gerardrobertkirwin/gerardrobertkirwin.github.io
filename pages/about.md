Some people are excellent at one thing, like professional athletes. Some people are average, people who can keep up with a pick-up basketball game in the park. And there are players who are really good shooters, there are players who are really good defenders. And there are players who do well in multiple parts of their game. I like to think of myself as one of those kind of people. I've never had one skill that I've been excellent at. 
&ast;*And one last note about basketball, despite being tall my whole life (an experience littered with "Do you play basketball?" until everyone realized I wasn't getting a Division 1 scholarship), I've only been a decent player the last few years. Sometimes it takes a little longer for those skills to come out.*
Can we do this? This is me. The text of the paragraph goes here. In this example, we have an image of a headshot photo, so this text would likely be about the person whom the headshot is for.
