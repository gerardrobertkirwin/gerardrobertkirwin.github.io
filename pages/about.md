Some people are excellent at one thing, like professional athletes. Some people are average, people who can keep up with a pick-up basketball game in the park. And there are players who are really good shooters, there are players who are really good defenders. And there are players who do well in multiple parts of their game but aren't excellent in just one area\*. I like to think of myself as one of those kind of people. <br><br>
As a kid, I was really bright and very interested in becoming a TV meteorologist. I followed this dream into college when I realized I was very good at calculus, physics and thermodynamics and I was very good at developing and communicating forecasts but not *excellent* at it. This, and graduating in the middle of the recession, led me down another path, to teaching.<br><br>
I ended up teaching, including my time as a substitute and as a student teacher, for 7 years. I was very good at explaining chemistry and physics concepts to unmotivated art school kids and was very good at handling the ups and downs of dealing with teenagers 193 days a year, but I was not *excellent* at it. This, and barely surviving wave after wave of budget cuts, led me down yet another path. This is what brought me to data analysis. <br><br>
I know I have very good analytical skills and very good communication skills. I know I have good coding skills and good organizing skills. I love the big picture and the minute details. I feel like being very good at all these skills is vital for a data analyst, a job that requires a lot of being "very good" at a number of things but doesn't require being "excellent" at one thing. I think I've found a perfect fit for me.<br><br>
\*One more note about basketball. Despite being tall my whole life (an experience littered with "Do you play basketball?" until everyone realized I wasn't getting a Division 1 scholarship), I've only been a decent player the last few years. Sometimes it takes a little longer for those skills to come out. And yes, I would like to play sometime.
